## 4. Top 10 Actionable Recommendations (Sorted by Impact)

### HIGH IMPACT

- **Why:** 80%+ of B2B buyers want to see pricing before contacting sales

#### 2. Implement Calendar Booking (Calendly/Cal.com)
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: LOW**
- Replace or supplement contact form with calendar booking widget
- Embed on contact page AND as floating CTA
- Reduces friction from "fill form → wait for reply → schedule" to one click
- Cal.com is free and open-source
- **Why:** Every hour of delay reduces conversion probability by 10%

#### 3. Collect 5-8 More Client Testimonials
**Impact: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM**
- Currently only 1 visible testimonial vs. competitors with 3-4

- **Why:** Free audits are the #1 lead generation tool in PPC consulting

#### 8. Add Multi-Step Lead Qualification Form
**Impact: MEDIUM | Effort: MEDIUM**

## 6. Key Takeaway

**slobodan-jelisavac.com is already competitive** in terms of design, content volume, and differentiation (AI angle, multi-market expertise, UK Search Awards). The biggest gap is in **conversion optimization** — the site attracts visitors but could do much more to convert them. The top 4 recommendations (pricing transparency, calendar booking, more testimonials, lead magnet) would close the gap with market leaders significantly.

The **AI-powered optimization angle is genuinely unique** — no analyzed competitor mentions AI tools. This should be amplified as a key differentiator, especially as the market shifts toward AI-augmented PPC management.
